# Purpose of Analysis
The Humans Resources (HR) Department at Pewlett Hackard is preparing for the ”Silver Tsunami”, also known as the large employee retirement by the Boomer generation. The purpose of our project is to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. Our retiring employees by title information will show the titles of all employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.

To organize the data tables in a manner to easily understand throughout the analysis, an Entity Relationship Diagram was created to visualize the table relationships. Each data table provided was incorporated into the below ERD to assist in the SQL joins in the subsequent analysis.

# Results
*	A significant proportion of the Pewlett Hackard workforce is eligible for retirement in the coming years. Nearly 94,000 employees at various levels of the company, heavily weighted in the Senior Engineer sector, may be leaving the company. This amount of people leaving the workforce may leave Pewlett Hackard with insufficient staffing to complete tasks. 

*	Nearly 64% of the retiring workforce is of a senior level (senior engineer or senior staff). This higher level of knowledge and skill departing the workforce needs to be reviewed to potential promotions from younger staff. Does Pewlett Hackard have lower-level employees that are ready to be promoted? Will external talent need to be recruited?

*	There are limited managers retiring from the workforce in the analyzed section. This may provide some relief if departments can be combined or a remaining employee can be promoted into place. 

*	The mentorship program is limited in scope. Only a single year of birth was requested to be analyzed for eligibility of mentorship. This limits the pool of mentors to 1,549 persons, which is likely not sufficient for the remaining employees. An expanded analysis is discussed below.

# Summary
Although 94,000 personnel are retiring, not all roles may need to be filled. Analysis by management is needed to understand the roles and responsibilities of each personal that is retiring. If technology has changed or the strategy of the company has been modified in recent years, positions may be able to be eliminated and not refilled. 

The Company should also review the second wave of the ‘Silver Tsunami’ for retirement. In a review of the employees with birth dates between 1956 and 1960, this group includes over 115,000 people who may be retiring soon after this first wave. This reduction in the work force combined with the original wave will have a significant impact on the productivity of Pewlett Hackard. 

As previously mentioned, the mentorship eligibility is limited to a single birth year. By expanding the birth years from 1962 to 1965, this includes nearly 57,000 people, significantly more than the original analysis. This expansion may provide sufficient personnel to mentor the next generation of senior personnel.
